  <h1> Comparing the current U.S. economy to past economies during a recession </h1>
    <p> By: Dana Bryan </p>
    <p> This will compare what the U.S. economy looks like now to what the U.S. economy has looked like prior to a recession in the United States economy in past years. One of the major indicators of a recession in a country is the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is the percentage of people in the workforce who do not have a job. The unemployment rate is a good indicator of an economy's position because it provides insight on if America's resources are being used efficiently. It also shows how individuals are affected by a poor or good economy.</p>
